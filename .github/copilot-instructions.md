# Agentic AI System for Protein Science

This workspace contains a comprehensive agentic AI system for protein science research, integrating protein language models, molecular simulation tools, and autonomous reasoning layers.

## Project Structure
- `foundation/`: Protein Intelligence Core (PLMs, structure prediction, function prediction)
- `agents/`: Agentic Layer (reasoning, planning, tool integration)
- `collaboration/`: Multi-Agent System (specialized agents, coordinator)
- `interface/`: Interface Layer (APIs, notebooks, chat interface)
- `data/`: Datasets and benchmarks
- `simulations/`: Molecular simulation tools and workflows
- `examples/`: Example notebooks and workflows
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests

## Development Guidelines
- Use type hints throughout the codebase
- Follow scientific computing best practices
- Integrate with established protein science tools (GROMACS, OpenMM, AlphaFold)
- Maintain modular, extensible architecture
- Include comprehensive documentation and examples

## Key Dependencies
- PyTorch, Transformers (Hugging Face)
- BioPython, MDAnalysis
- LangChain for agent orchestration
- FastAPI for REST APIs
- Streamlit for interactive interfaces
